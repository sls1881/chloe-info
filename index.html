            <p>Hello new friend—My name is Chloe and I’m a Chiweenie. At least that’s what we think I am. I’m four years
                old and I love to cuddle. I am a little nervous around new people, big dogs, and without my mom, but I’m
                excited to be your friend. </p>
            <p>My mom says I don’t dog very well because I don’t chase balls and mostly just want to be held at the dog
                park, but I do like to play tug-a-war.</p>
            <p>My favorite place to be is a warm, blanketed lap. I also love car rides. I’m too small to have the window
                down, but I still like to go places with you.</p>
            <h2>Stuff you should know about Chloe</h2>
            <div class="image2"><img class='chloe image2' src='assets/tummy.jpg'
                    alt='Chloe stretching out for belly pets' /></div>
            <ul>
                <li>Chloe doesn’t have any known allergies—it’s ok to give her treats</li>
                <li>She grazes so you can fill her bowl and just leave food out</li>
                <li>She’ll whine if she needs to go potty, but she’ll also whine if she wants you to play with her</li>
                <li>She normally poops once or twice a day</li>
                <li>I walk her about 2 mile in the morning and another mile in the evening to get her little legs moving
                </li>
                <li>She likes to sleep with you but might not sleep under the covers the first few nights</li>
                <li>If you bring her to work she might be a little nervous and sometimes barks at the other dogs</li>
                <li>If I see a dog before she does I say “No barking” to prevent her from starting</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Training and Commands</h2>
            <div class="image3"><img class='chloe' src='assets/blanket.jpg' alt='Chloe resting on a blanket' />
                <ol>
                    <li>Chloe is trained to walk on the right side, sometimes she wonders a little</li>
                    <li>She knows sit, stay, wait, come, laydown, and high five</li>
                    <li>When releasing a wait or stay command I say “All done”</li>
                </ol>
                <p>These are only important if you want to use them.</p>
